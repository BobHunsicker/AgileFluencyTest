The Agile Fluency Test project is an open-source project, inspired by "Your Path through Agile Fluency" (http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html), an article written by Diana Larsen and James Shore. The purpose of this project is to help development teams assess if they are reaching their agile goals.

It should be noted that it is NOT our opinion that all four levels of "agile fluency" are appropriate for all developers, all products, and all markets.

There are a number of great resources available for agile fluency test questions, following the concepts introduced in the article above. Here are some of the articles we used to develop and inspire test questions:

Four Star Fluency:
Yet to be adequately explained because it is the cutting edge of agile development! As resources are located, they should be added and referenced to verify question usefulness.

Other Agile Assessments:
There are two simple test we found to assess whether Agile development is being used, which we borrowed content from. They are also great stand alone resources for Agile developers.
